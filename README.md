Trivial Status Reports
========

Overview
--------

This is a simple python library for reporting the status of "test" points
to a simple markdown (git) repo.

I haven't really packaged it for reuse yet (still learning how to bundle libraries).
I just dropped in the skeleton of package management files for now.

For my short term use, I'm simply copying the lib into another project.
